# plank-theme-joey  
A bit like Sierra :)  
Dark Theme  
If you prefer a lighter theme -  
https://github.com/ar0ra1/plank-theme-jenny.git

### Instructions

`# git clone https://github.com/ar0ra1/plank-theme-joey.git /usr/share/plank/themes/joey/ `  
`$ plank --preferences`  
`choose theme = joey`  

Works best with intellihide behaviour!

Feedback and improvements are always appreciated ;)
